Front-End Challenges & Fixes Branding alignment: Styled chatbot using React & CSS Modules for consistency.  Navigation issues: Fixed overlapping elements by switching absolute positioning to flexbox.  Smooth interaction: Used React Context API to manage updates efficiently.  Back-End Challenges & Fixes Slow API responses: Improved speed with Redis caching and optimized queries.  Handling large data: Implemented pagination for better performance.  Understanding user input: Used RegEx and NLP to improve chatbot responses."

Let's dive into some specific questions to understand your experience as a Fullstack Developer on that project.\n\n1.  **Tell me more about your experience with React Context API. Can you explain a specific situation where using it significantly improved the performance or maintainability of the chatbot's front-end? What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you choose Context API?**\n\n2.  **You mentioned improving API response times with Redis caching. Could you elaborate on the specific caching strategy you employed (e.g., cache-aside, write-through)? What metrics did you use to measure the performance improvement after implementing Redis, and what were the results?**\n\n3.  **In terms of backend optimization, describe the types of queries you optimized? What tools or techniques did you use to identify the slow queries, and what specific changes did you make to improve their performance (e.g., indexing, query restructuring)?**\n\n4.  **Regarding the use of RegEx and NLP for understanding user input, could you describe a specific challenge you encountered in interpreting user queries and how you leveraged these technologies to overcome it? What NLP libraries or services did you use, and why?**\n\n5.  **The tech stack for full-stack roles can be quite diverse, could you tell me more about your experience in relation to databases, and what your preferred choice would be based on the challenges of the chatbot.**\n\n6.  **Let's talk about testing. How did you approach testing the chatbot, both on the front-end and back-end? What types of tests did you write (e.g., unit, integration, end-to-end), and what tools did you use to automate the testing process?**\n"
