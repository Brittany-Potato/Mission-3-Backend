That concludes the interview.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nWhile I appreciate your candor, some of your responses raise concerns about your suitability for a banking role. Honesty and self-awareness are valuable qualities, but your answers suggest potential issues with:\n\n*   **Integrity and Ethical Conduct:** Your mention of robbing a bank and lack of adherence to laws are serious red flags.\n*   **Customer Service Skills:** Yelling and slapping customers is completely unacceptable in a customer-facing role.\n*   **Professionalism and Communication:** The ability to communicate effectively and empathetically is crucial for a banker.\n*   **Experience:** There is no positive relevant experience in your answers.\n\nOverall, based on this interview, I cannot recommend you for the Banker position at this time. I encourage you to reflect on the feedback provided and consider how you can develop skills and experiences that align with the expectations of a professional banking environment.\n"
