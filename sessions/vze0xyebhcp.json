While I haven't deeply explored Django, Flask, or Spring, I do understand their structures and best use cases.  Optimizing a Slow API Endpoint In a project involving React and API integration (e.g., Turners Car Auctions chatbot), I encountered slow API response times due to excessive data processing and inefficient request handling.  Steps I Took to Optimize It: Identified the Bottleneck  Used logging tools (console.log, Postman, and network tab in DevTools) to track API delays.  Checked response times using performance.now() and database query speed."

Powerful queries with SQL for complex data relationships.  Ideal for applications requiring strong data integrity (e.g., financial systems, e-commerce).  ❌ Weaknesses:  Scaling can be complex—requires"
